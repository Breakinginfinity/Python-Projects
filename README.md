# Python-Google_Playstore_Data_Analysis


pandas is a python library for doing exploratory data analysis.

There are great docs and lots of online tutorials teaching the basics, but I've seen a lot of people asking what they can work on after they've gone through the tutorials.

My aim here is to create a list of project ideas that are exciting and practical.

Most projects include:

- An explanation of why the dataset is interesting
- Ideas for questions the data can answer
- A bit of sample data you can play with (in some cases)
- Instructions for how to get data

Repository containing Python projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Pyfiles, Excel datasets, PDF.
